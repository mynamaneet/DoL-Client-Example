:: Coast Path Mer [nobr]
<<set $outside to 1>><<effects>>

You walk down a thin road near the docks, leading away from Mer Street. It feeds into a warehouse, but to one side is a sandy trail, hidden among tufts of spiky grass. It takes you into the hills that flank the town, snaking the tops of the cliffs facing the sea.
<br><br>

Few know the path is here.

:: Coast Path Meadow [nobr]

:: Coast Path East [nobr]
<<effects>>

You follow the path east. It sometimes runs along the very top of the cliffs. At other times it dips part way down, so that the route squeezes between a rock face on one side, and a sheer drop on the other.

<br><br>
You see fields in the distance.

:: Coast Path West [nobr]
<<effects>>

You follow the path west. Wild grasses and other plants intrude on it, sometimes swallowing it all, but it's not hard to find again. It always hugs the cliff.
<br><br>
You see the town in the distance.
