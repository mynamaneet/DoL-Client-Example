You run after the <<fox_text>>, hoping there's no one else around to see. You don't know what they'd make of a naked <<girl>> running across the meadow.

You enter the surrounding trees. Your eyes adjust to the dim light, and you see your quarry scurry into a hole up ahead.

You keep running, jumping over fallen branches, until you arrive at the hole. You peer inside, but can't see very far.

You see the end of the tunnel up ahead, lit by an unseen source. The tunnel turns, opening into a larger cavern. Another pool of water laps at a shore, but this one is different. Darker, and looking straight at it fills you with dread. As if something were looking back.<<gstress>>
