	A light turns on inside an upper story room. A silhouette appears behind the curtains, and the window is thrown open. A <<generate1>><<person1>><<person>>leans out. "Stupid cat," <<he>> shouts.

		Light glints off the object <<he>> threw. It's a watch. It might be worth something, if you could find a buyer.

:: Residential Pet [nobr]

<<set $outside to 1>><<set $location to "town">><<effects>>
You crouch and rub the cat's head. It purrs and rubs against you, before flicking you with its tail and leaping onto a nearby wall. It disappears behind it.

:: Residential Tease [nobr]

<<set $outside to 1>><<set $location to "town">><<effects>>
Purring seductively, you drop to the ground and assume a mating posture. Eager, it leaps on top of you and humps as it struggles to find purchase. You grab it by the scruff and pull it away from your body, lay it on its back, and rub its belly. It meows in frustration as it struggles free, and leaps onto a nearby wall before disappearing behind it.
