Many of the patients satisfy themselves with the fallen security personnel, but others fuck each other on tables, chairs or just the floor.

You look out the window. The towers are unmanned and the patrols missing as all hands arrive to contain the threat. Doctor Harper enters from a door opposite, surrounded by security. Now's your chance.
